This AUP is designed to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to the Resident Service. This AUP also protects the interests of all of our clients and their customers, as well as our goodwill and reputation. These terms are so important that we cannot provide the Resident Service unless you agree to them. By using the Resident Service, you are agreeing to these terms.<\/p>\n<p>If you are using any Resident Service, this AUP applies to you. Every client of ours agrees to abide by this AUP and is responsible for any violations. You are not allowed to assist or engage others in a way that would violate this AUP. We will enforce and ensure compliance with this AUP by using methods we consider to be appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring.<\/p>\n<p>We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do through the Notification app in the Resident portal used to access your Resident subscription (if you have one), or by posting a revised copy on our website. You agree to review the AUP on a regular basis and always remain in compliance.<\/p>\n<p>1. Reporting Suspected Violations<\/p>\n<p>We encourage recipients of email messages sent using the Resident Service to report suspected violations of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the received email with FULL headers to abuse@Resident.com. We have a policy to investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way we consider appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>If you know of or suspect a violation of this AUP, you will promptly notify us in writing of the known or suspected violation of this AUP.<\/p>\n<p>2. No SPAM Permitted<\/p>\n<p>You may not use the Resident Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle, distribute or deliver: (a) unsolicited email (\"spam\" or \"spamming\") in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other law; (b) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods (e.g., scraping or harvesting); (c) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and\/or not updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the industry, or (d) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (referenced below). &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. Prohibited Email Content and Formatting; Email Best Practices<\/p>\n<p>Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the Baseline Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid or forged headers; (b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (c) employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path; (d) use other means of deceptive addressing; (e) use a third party's internet domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party's equipment without the third party’s permission; (f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (g) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s) without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.<\/p>\n<p><span>If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers.

It describes the services we will provide to you, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business relationship. It is a legal document so some of the language is necessarily &ldquo;legalese&rdquo;, but we have tried to make it as readable as possible. These terms are so important that we cannot provide our products and services to you unless you agree to them. By using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services, you are agreeing to these terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We periodically update these terms. If you have an active Resident subscription, we will let you know when we do via an email or in-app notification. You can find archived versions of the terms <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/legal.hubspot.com\/legal-stuff\/archive?hsLang=fr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we know legal terms can sometimes be difficult to navigate, so we wanted to give you a roadmap of the Agreement:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A. DEFINITIONS. This is where we provide the detail on what the key defined terms in the Agreement mean. You can think of this kind of like a contractual dictionary.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B. GENERAL COMMERCIAL TERMS. Here&rsquo;s where you can find the basics about how our Subscription Service and Consulting Services are provided. For example, you can find information on access and acceptable use. These terms apply to all of our products and service offerings.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. SUBSCRIPTION TERMS. Customers of ours subscribe to use our software (yep, it&rsquo;s SaaS), and there are some fundamental terms that apply to each subscription. There are some differences between the different types of subscriptions, and here&rsquo;s where you can find that detail.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D. PRODUCT DISCLOSURES.&nbsp; We offer several different products and there are some important things to know before you use them. We&rsquo;ve collected these important things to know and you can find them <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/legal.hubspot.com\/product-disclosures?hsLang=fr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS. As we mention above, this is a contract, and contracts are filled with legal terms. In this section, we&rsquo;ve collected the many of the remaining legal terms that make up our Customer Terms of Service.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F. JURISDICTION SPECIFIC TERMS. With customers across the globe, this final section is where we address most of the differences in these terms that vary based on customer location.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DEFINITIONS<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Agreement\" means these Customer Terms of Service and all materials referred or linked to in here.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Paid Users&rdquo; means those types of Users (defined below) for which we charge you fees as set forth in our Product and Services Catalog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Billing Period\" means the period for which you agree to prepay fees under an Order Form, which will be the same as or shorter than the Subscription Term.

We might provide some or all elements of the Subscription Service through third party service providers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Additional Features. You may subscribe to additional features of the Subscription Service by placing an additional Order or activating the additional features from within your Resident account (if this option is made available by us.). This Agreement will apply to all additional Order(s) and all additional features that you activate from within your Resident account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Availability. We try to make the Subscription Service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for planned down-time for maintenance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consulting Services. You may purchase Consulting Services by placing an Order with us. Unless we otherwise agree, the Consulting Services we provide are described in the Product and Services Catalog and will be delivered in English.&nbsp; Fees for these Consulting Services are in addition to your Subscription Fee. If you purchase Consulting Services that recur, they will be considered part of your subscription and will renew in accordance with your subscription.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All Consulting Services are performed remotely, unless you and we otherwise agree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Consulting Services performed on-site, you will reimburse us our reasonable costs for all expenses incurred in connection with the Consulting Services.

If there is no Expiration Period or Delivery Period indicated, then it will be one hundred and eighty (180) days from purchase.&nbsp; If the Consulting Services provided are not complete at the end of the Delivery Period due to your failure to make the necessary resources available to us or to perform your obligations, such Consulting Services will be deemed to be complete at the end of the Delivery Period. If the Consulting Services provided are not complete at the end of the Delivery Period due to our failure to make the necessary resources available to you or to perform our obligations, the Delivery Period will be extended to allow us to complete such Consulting Services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We might provide some or all elements of the Consulting Services through third party service providers.&nbsp; Consulting Services are non-cancellable and all fees for Consulting Services are non-refundable.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fees and Payments<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Subscription Fees. The Subscription Fee will remain fixed during the Subscription Term unless you: (i) exceed your Maximum Contacts, Email Send Limit, User or other applicable limits (see the &lsquo;Limits&rsquo; section below), (ii) upgrade products or base packages,&nbsp; (iii) subscribe to additional features or products, including additional Contacts, or (iv) unless otherwise agreed to in the Order.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our Full-Service Marketing Products, once increased, your Subscription Fee will not decrease, even if there is a subsequent reduction in the number of Contacts or emails sent. We will monitor or audit remotely the number of Contacts in the Subscription Service and the number of emails that you send on the Subscription Service. If you subscribe to our Full-Service Marketing Products, this information is also made available to you in your Resident account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our products that have applicable User limits, you will be charged fees associated with all Paid Users.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fee Adjustments in Next Billing Period. We determine the Contact tier for the next Billing Period by reviewing the number of Contacts in your account.&nbsp; For our Full-Service Marketing Products, we complete this review between forty (40) and twenty-five (25) days before the start of your next Billing Period. For our Marketing Starter product, we complete this review on the last day of your Billing Period. If the number of Contacts in your account exceed your Maximum Contacts when we complete this review, then your Subscription Fee will increase at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the tier price which corresponds with the reviewed number of Contacts.&nbsp; Tier prices are as set forth in our Product and Services Catalog.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We allow you to reasonably manage the number of Contacts during the course of a Billing Period and will not count Contacts removed before our review, unless these Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase. If Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase, we may consider the maximum number of Contacts from the reviewed Billing Period for the purposes of determining your Contact tier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This review and upgrade process will continue for each Billing Period during the Subscription Term.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fee Adjustments During a Billing Period. For our Full-Service Marketing Products, the Subscription Fee will increase during the course of a Billing Period if you exceed your Email Send Limit in a Billing Period.

We will monitor or audit remotely the number of Contacts in the Subscription Service and the number of emails that you send on the Subscription Service. If you subscribe to our Full-Service Marketing Products, this information is also made available to you in your Resident account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our products that have applicable User limits, you will be charged fees associated with all Paid Users.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fee Adjustments in Next Billing Period. We determine the Contact tier for the next Billing Period by reviewing the number of Contacts in your account.&nbsp; For our Full-Service Marketing Products, we complete this review between forty (40) and twenty-five (25) days before the start of your next Billing Period. For our Marketing Starter product, we complete this review on the last day of your Billing Period. If the number of Contacts in your account exceed your Maximum Contacts when we complete this review, then your Subscription Fee will increase at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the tier price which corresponds with the reviewed number of Contacts.&nbsp; Tier prices are as set forth in our Product and Services Catalog.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We allow you to reasonably manage the number of Contacts during the course of a Billing Period and will not count Contacts removed before our review, unless these Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase. If Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase, we may consider the maximum number of Contacts from the reviewed Billing Period for the purposes of determining your Contact tier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This review and upgrade process will continue for each Billing Period during the Subscription Term.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fee Adjustments During a Billing Period. For our Full-Service Marketing Products, the Subscription Fee will increase during the course of a Billing Period if you exceed your Email Send Limit in a Billing Period. In this case, the Subscription Fee will increase to the tier price which corresponds with your maximum monthly email sends from the current Billing Period.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our Marketing Starter product, if you reach your Email Send Limit, you will not be able to send any more emails until the start of the next calendar month, including emails pre-scheduled to go out after reaching the Email Send Limit.&nbsp; Kick-back emails from form conversion will not be interrupted. You may increase your Email Send Limit by purchasing additional Contacts, in which case your fee will increase during the course of a Billing Period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Subscription Fee will increase during a Billing Period up to the corresponding base package and tier price (as set forth in our Product and Services Catalog) if you exceed the subdomains limit, add Paid Users, exceed other applicable limits (except as set forth in the &lsquo;Fee Adjustments in Next Billing Period&rsquo; section), change or add products, or subscribe to additional features for use during the Billing Period. We may choose to decrease your fees upon written notice to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fee Adjustments at Renewal. For our Sales and Service products, upon renewal, your subscription will be adjusted to match the number of Users actually assigned at the end of your then-current Subscription Term, provided that, if you purchased a product with included Users, then you&rsquo;ll continue to have those Users included even if they are not assigned.&nbsp; For our Marketing Starter product, upon renewal, your subscription will be adjusted to match Contact tier that corresponds with the number of Contacts in your portal on the last day of your then-current Subscription Term.&nbsp; For more detail on renewal pricing, see the &lsquo;Term and Renewal&rsquo; section below.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Payment by credit card. If you are paying by credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account for all fees payable during the Subscription Term. You further authorize us to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Payment against invoice. If you are paying by invoice, we will invoice you no more than forty-five (45) days before the beginning of the Subscription Term and each subsequent Billing Period, and other times during the Subscription Term when fees are payable. All amounts invoiced are due and payable within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Payment Information.
